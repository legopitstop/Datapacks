# CHANGELOG v1.3.0

## General

- Completely rewrote pack, new fresh code
- Now uses a custom item
- Diffrent system all together, Greatly decreased file size. (was 203KB, now 13KB)
- Calculator buttons can be changed in the resourcepack lang file, may add custom unicode characters.
- you can now use larger numbers, be careful some super large numbers will cause issues max 9 digits due to minecrafts number limit inside scoreboards.
- May add more calculators, like a stack calculator to calculate how many items you have ex: 3 stacks - 5 items = 197 total items, and/or add more buttons like square root, pi, sine, cosine, tangent, and even add input support for negative numbers.
