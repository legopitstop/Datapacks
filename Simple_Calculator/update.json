        "1.3.0": "# v1.3.0 ChangeLog\n## New\n+ Completely rewrote pack, new fresh code\n+ Now uses a custom item\n+ Different system altogether Greatly decreased file size. (was 203KB, now 13KB)\n+ Calculator buttons can be changed in the resource pack lang file, may add custom Unicode characters.\n+ you can now use larger numbers, be careful some super large numbers will cause issues max 9 digits due to Minecraft number limit inside scoreboards.\n+ May add more calculators, like a stack calculator to calculate how many items you have ex: 3 stacks + 5 items = 197 total items, and/or add more buttons like square root, pi, sine, cosine, tangent, and even add input support for negative numbers."
